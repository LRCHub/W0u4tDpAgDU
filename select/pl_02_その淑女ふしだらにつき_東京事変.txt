I've wined and dined
on MulliganStew,
and never wished for Turkey
As I hitched and hiked
and grifted too,
from Maine to Albuquerque
Alas,
I missed the Beaux ArtsBall,
and what is twice as sad
I've never been to a party where
they honored Noel Ca-ad (Coward)
But social circles
moved too fast for me
My "hobohemia"
is the place tobe
I get too hungry,
for dinner at eight
I like the theater,
but never come late
I never bother, with people I
hate
That's why the lady is a tramp
I don't like crap games,
with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem,
in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt,
with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp
I like the free, fresh
wind in my hair
Life without care
I'm broke, it's o'k
Hate California,
it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp
Girls get massages,
they cry and they moan.
Tell Slender Ella
to leave me alone
I’m not so hot,
but my shape is my own
That’s why the lady is a tramp
The food at the Kopensky is
perfect, no doubt
I couldn’t tell you
what the Ritz is about.
Drop a nickel in
and coffee comes out
That’s why the lady is a tramp
I like the sweet fresh
rain in my face
Diamonds and lace,
no got, so what?
For Frank Sinatra,
I whistle andI stamp
That’s why the lady is a tramp
She’s a hobo
She’s a scamp
She’s a no-good kinda tramp
That’s why the lady is a tramp
